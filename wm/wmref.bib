              Introduction
              
                The diagnostic and classificatory performances of all combinations of three core (amyloid β peptide [i.e., Aβ
                1–42
                ], total tau [t‐tau], and phosphorylated tau) and three novel (neurofilament light chain protein, neurogranin, and YKL‐40) cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of neurodegeneration were compared among individuals with mild cognitive impairment (n = 41), Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD; n = 35), frontotemporal dementia (FTD; n = 9), and cognitively healthy controls (HC; n = 21), using 10‐fold cross‐validation.
              
            
            
              Methods
              The combinations ranking in the top 10 according to diagnostic accuracy in differentiating between distinct diagnostic categories were identified.
            
            
              Results
              The single biomarkers or biomarker combinations generating the best area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROCs) were the following: the combination [amyloid β peptide + phosphorylated tau + neurofilament light chain] for distinguishing between ADD patients and HC (AUROC = 0.86), t‐tau for distinguishing between ADD and FTD patients (AUROC = 0.82), and t‐tau for distinguishing between FTD patients and HC (AUROC = 0.78).
            
            
              Conclusions
              Novel and established cerebrospinal fluid markers perform with at least fair accuracy in the discrimination between ADD and FTD. The classification of mild cognitive impairment individuals was poor.

                    Interest in novel biomarkers of neurodegeneration is growing.
                  
                  
                    We measured novel and established cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers.
                  
                  
                    The diagnostic performances of all combinations were investigated.

              Introduction
              Cognitive change in people at risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) such as subjective memory complainers is highly variable across individuals.
            
            
              Methods
              We used latent class growth modeling to identify distinct classes of nonlinear trajectories of cognitive change over 2 years follow‐up from 265 subjective memory complainers individuals (age 70 years and older) of the INSIGHT‐preAD cohort. We determined the effect of cortical amyloid load, hippocampus and basal forebrain volumes, and education on the cognitive trajectory classes.
            
            
              Results
              Latent class growth modeling identified distinct nonlinear cognitive trajectories. Education was associated with higher performing trajectories, whereas global amyloid load and basal forebrain atrophy were associated with lower performing trajectories.
            
            
              Discussion
              Distinct classes of cognitive trajectories were associated with risk and protective factors of AD. These associations support the notion that the identified cognitive trajectories reflect different risk for AD that may be useful for selecting high‐risk individuals for intervention trials.},
