The images were retrospectively acquired from patients with suspicion of lung cancer, and who underwent standard-of-care lung biopsy and PET/CT. Subjects were grouped according to a tissue histopathological diagnosis. Patients with Names/IDs containing the letter 'A' were diagnosed with Adenocarcinoma, 'B' with Small Cell Carcinoma, 'C' with Large Cell Carcinoma, and 'G' with Squamous Cell Carcinoma.},
